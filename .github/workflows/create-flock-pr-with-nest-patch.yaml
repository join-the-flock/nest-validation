# This workflow looks for changes to Flock patches within Nest, and then
# creates a parallel PR in the Flock repository.
#
# Nest accumulates changes to Flutter in the form of patch files. These patch
# files are plaid on top of Flutter to create a version called Flock. Reviewing
# patch files in isolation is counterproductive, because developers can't see
# any of the code around the changes. This workflow plays back the patches in
# Nest and generates a PR against Flock showing that actual diff caused by
# those patches.
#
# If a PR is submitted to Nest without any changes to patches, then this
# workflow does nothing.
#
# After this workflow runs, go to github.com/join-the-flock/flock and locate
# the new PR with the Flutter diff. Review the changes there. When satisfied
# with the changes, close the PR in Flock, and merge the PR in Nest.
